# AirBnB-Price-Prediction

Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows homeowners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts are expected to set their own prices for their listings. Although Airbnb and other sites provide some general guidance, there are currently no free and accurate services which help hosts price their properties using a wide range of data points. Airbnb pricing is important to get right particularly in big cities like New York where there is lots of competition and even small differences in prices can make a big difference. It is also difficult thing to do correctly – price too high and no one will book. Price too low and you will be missing out on a lot of potential income.

This project aims to solve this problem, by using regressor models to predict the price for properties across major cities in the United States. By examining a large data set of past home rentals and finding patterns and statistical relationships between house’s characteristics and its price including patterns that might not be evident to a human who’s looking at the data. We have explored the preparation and cleaning of Airbnb data and conducted some exploratory data analysis. With this the users can know what features of an Airbnb listing are most important as well as how prices are fluctuating based on amenities, location etc.
